One of the most popular features in Spicetify is theming.
You can customize your Spotify to your <span style={{'color': '#CB1010'}}>**heart's**</span> desire!
**However**, this is a very cumbersome task.

For this reason, the theming heroes of the Spicetify community have created a massive library of themes which are available in the following repositories:

1. [morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes)
2. [NYRI4/Comfy-spicetify](https://github.com/NYRI4/Comfy-spicetify)

Also, check the default theme [here](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli/tree/master/Themes/SpicetifyDefault).
